<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
I am a researcher interested in the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and biosystems. My current research with Professor Weiyu Xu and Professor Raghu Mudumbai explores adversarial atacks against deep learning networks as part of an Iowa Center for Research by Undergraduates fellowship. This extends to constructing selective attacks that fool certain deep learning models but not others. This project has a secondary biological perspective in detecting adversarial attacks in MRI image reconstruction networks. Alongside this project, I have had another research fellowhsip investigating political discourse via natural language processing. Additionally, I have lab experience working with the Blumberg Lab of Psychological and Brain Sciences where I used machine learning to predict specific brain wave behavior and automated data collection using embedded systems. More information on these projects can be found in the Projects section.
